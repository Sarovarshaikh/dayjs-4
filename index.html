    <h1><span id="sp1">JS Interview Class 4-</span><span id="sp2">Sarovar Shaikh</span></h1>
    <h3>Q1. What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h3>
    <p>Ans- A temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the computer completely initializes it with a value.</p><hr>
    <h3>Q2. What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax.</h3>
    <p>Ans- The for...in statements combo iterates (loops) over the properties of an object.The code block inside the loop is executed once for each property.Keys of an object or strings can be accessed by for-in loop.</p>
    <pre>
        let object = {
            fname: "Sarovar",
            lname: "Shaikh",
        }
        
        for(let j in object){
            console.log(j); // fname, lname
        }
        
        let array = ["ana","bana","cana"];
        
        for(let i in array){
            console.log(i);
        }</pre>
        <p>Output- 0, 1, 2</p><hr>
    <h3>Q3. Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript.</h3>
    <p>Ans- Scope in JS</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Local Scope- accessible inside that function only</li>
        <li>Block Scope- Inside block of code, it will access the variables inside that block only.</li>
        <li>Functional Scope- Variables are valid only inside that function.</li>
        <li>Scope Chain- Variables are accessible inside and outside their scope.</li>
    </ul><hr>
    <h3>Q4. What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</h3>
    <p>Ans- Null: It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Undefined: It means the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.</p>
    <p>Type:</p>
    <p>Null: Object</p>  
    <p>Undefined: undefined</p>
    <h3>Q5. What is Symbol?</h3>
    <p>Ans- Symbols are a type of non-primitive datatype. They were introduced in Es-6 version. Symbols are immutable. The type of Symbol will always be Symbol and not object.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Symbols are unique in nature</li>
    </ul><hr>
    <h3>Q6. Write code to explain map and filter in arrays.</h3>
    <p>Ans- May and filter in arrays:</p>
    <p>When to use map: If we want to perform the same operation/transformation on each element of the array and get back a new array of the same length with the transformed values.</p>
    <pre>
        const arrayOne = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500];
        
        const arrayTwo = arrayOne.map( x => x + 50);</pre>
    <p>Output- [150,250,350,450,550]</p>
    <p>When to use filter- Every element of the array is passed to the callback function. On each iteration, if the callback returns true, then that element will be added to the new array, otherwise, it is not added to the new array.</p>
    <pre> const arrayThree = arrayOne.filter( x => x > 300);
        console.log(arrayThree);
        </pre>
    <p>Output- [400,500]</p><hr>
    <h3>Q7. Explain passed by value and passed by reference.</h3>
    <p>Ans- Passed by value-   works with Primitive Datatypes(null,undefined,boolean,number,bigint,string,symbol)</p>
    <p>In Pass by value, parameters passed as an arguments create its own copy. So any changes made inside the function is made to the copied value not to the original value.</p>
    <pre>
        let a = 10;
        let b = 5;
        
        b = a + 5;
        console.log(b);
        console.log(a);</pre>
    <p>Output-</p>
    <p>15</p>
    <p>10</p>
    <p>Passed by Reference- works with Primitive Datatypes( arrays and objects )</p>
    <p>In Pass by reference, parameters passed as an arguments does not create its own copy, it refers to the original value so changes made inside function affect the original value.</p>
    <pre>
        let objectt = {
            name: "Don",
            age: 24,
        }
        
        let objectt1 = objectt;
        
        objectt1.age = 28,
        console.log(objectt1);</pre>
    <p>Output- name:Don, age:28</p><hr>
    <h3>Q8. Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code.</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, a “Self-Invoking” function is a type of function that is invoked or called automatically after its definition. The execution of such an anonymous function is done by enclosing it in a parenthesis set followed by another set of parenthesis.</p>
    <p>Ans- It is also called ad Immediately Invoke Function Expression.i.e, IIFE function</p>
    <p>It is a way to immediately call a function</p>
    <p>It needs to be called as soon as it is defined.</p>
    <p>Function expressions can be made "self-invoking".</p>
    <p>Syntax-</p>
    <pre>
        (function () {
            console.log("Execute me first !!");
          })();
        </pre>
    <p>Output- Execute me first !!</p>
